This notebook demonstrates a binary classification workflow using a custom train-test split strategy. It selects the first 70 samples from Class 0 and the first 140 samples from Class 1 for training, with the remaining samples reserved for testing. It likely involves preprocessing, visualization, and evaluating model performance on imbalanced or structured datasets.
